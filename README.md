# üìà Algorithmic Trading

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks with research on various algorithmic trading strategies, including trend following, machine learning models, statistical arbitrage, and reinforcement learning.

## Contents

- **`at1.ipynb`** ‚Äì Trend Following Strategy  
  Implementation of a basic trend-following strategy using moving averages and signal thresholds.

- **`at4_1.ipynb`** and **`at4_2.ipynb`** ‚Äì Machine Learning Based Strategies  
  Strategies using models such as:
  - Linear Regression  
  - Lasso Regression  
  - Combined Models  
  - Random Forest  
  - CatBoost (with hyperparameter tuning)  
  Also includes walk-forward optimization techniques.

- **`at7.ipynb`** ‚Äì Statistical Arbitrage / Pair Trading  
  - Search for the most correlated asset pairs  
  - Conduct statistical tests (ADF, KPSS)  
  - Check spread stationarity and mean reversion properties

- **`at9.ipynb`** ‚Äì Strategy Aggregation and Dynamic Allocation  
  - Aggregation of multiple strategies  
  - Dynamic portfolio weight allocation in real-time  
  - Use of recursive updating and exponential decay factors

- **`addition.ipynb`** ‚Äì Advanced Enhancements  
  - Fixed data leakage in CatBoost strategy
